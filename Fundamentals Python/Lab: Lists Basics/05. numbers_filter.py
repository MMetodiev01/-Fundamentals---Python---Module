# On the first line, you will receive a single number number. On the following number lines, you will receive integers.\
# After that, you will be given one of the following commands:
# 路 even
# 路 odd
# 路 negative
# 路 positive
# Filter all the numbers that fit in the category (0 counts as a positive and even). Finally, print the result.
